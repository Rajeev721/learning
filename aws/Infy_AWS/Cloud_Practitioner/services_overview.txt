Recap:

EC2:Elastic compute cloud
IaaS
Virtual instance 

Region selection 

AMI , instance type, storage, tags, security groups, keypairs

Pricing models:
On demand, Reserved, Spot 

Tenancy: Shared, Dedicated 

Beanstalk: PAAS --> virtual server + runtime platform 
Lambda: FAAS, serverless service


Storage services:

S3:
Global service
simple storage service
can store any amount of data 
any kind of data --> text, audio, video 
no --> storage capacity 

buckets -- container 
Objects -- actual data + metadata

benefits:
highly scalable 
availability : 99.99% 
durability: 11 9's 

Storage classes:

S3 standard: for frequently accessed data 
S3 Standard IA: less frequently access data, use case: backups
S3 one zone IA: less frequently access data, only in 1 AZ, use case: secondary backups, easily recreatable data 
S3 intelligent tiering: no idea of access pattern, automation and monitoring 
Data --> accessed --> standard --> 30 days --> standard IA --> accessed --> standard 

S3 glacier: for archival purpose, retrival time -- less 
S3 glacier deep archive: cheapest , retrival time -- more


Redundantly storing your data:
in atleast 3 diff AZs of the region 

One zone --> stored in 1 AZ

Create a bucket, adding objects 

Name, Select the region


EBS:
Elastic block storage:
block storage 
as additional storage for your EC2 
Ec2 deleted --> delete on termination is enabled --> EBS volumes will also be deleted


VPC:
Virtual Private cloud
setup logically isolated segment
configure the firewall rules -- incoming and outgoing traffic
launch resources inside VPC --> Ec2 instances 
define and control 
Regional service

Create a VPC -> set of IP addresses --> CIDR notation
IPv4 addresses --> 32 bits 

CIDR notation:

IP address/netmasking value 

10.0.0.0/24 --> 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 --> 256 IP address

8 bits --> 00000000 -- 11111111 

10.0.0.0/16 --> 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255 --> 2^16 --> 65536 IP address  


10.0.0.0/24 --> 10.0.0.x --> 2^(32-24) --> 2^8

10.0.0.0/16 --> 2^(32-16) --> 2^16

10.0.0.0/x  --> 2^(32-x) 

10.0.0.0/32 --> 1 IP address


 


Components of VPC:

Subnets: division of VPC into smaller sections

VPC --> 10.0.0.0/16
Subnet1 --> 10.0.0.0/24
Subnet2 --> 10.0.1.0/24

CIDR range of subnet --> subset of VPC CIDR range, multiple subnets --> no overlapping IP address range 
 
selecting VPC, subnet 

will be in single AZ

Subnet 1 -> 10.0.0.0/24 --> 256 IP addresses 
Available Ip addresses --> which can be given to resources --> 251

5 Ip addresses/subnet --> reserved by AWS
first four and last one --> will be reserved --> 10.0.0.0, 1, 2 , 3 ... 10.0.0.255

for network address
VPC local router, DNS server, future use
Network broadcast addresses

Route tables:
set of rules --> guides your traffic
Every subnet --> can have 1 RT at max associated to it 
1 RT --> subnet1, subnet2

Custom Route tables
Main Route table 


VPC --> 10.0.0.0/16
Subnet1 --> 10.0.0.0/24
Subnet2 --> 10.0.1.0/24


10.0.0.0/16  target - local 

the resources within the Same VPC --> can be in diff subnets --> they can easily communicate

NACLs , Security groups




Internet Gateway


Database services:

Database considerations?? 
Type of data --> structured, flexbile schema

Relational database:RDS, Redshift 
Non Relational databases: DynamoDB, ElasticCache, Neptune

RDS:
Managed relational database offering

Why not deploy database in EC2 instance?? 

DB updates, backups --> Managed by us

lot of administration work 

Advantages:
-- Scaling abilities -- scaling is dynamic
-- Multi AZ --> Disaster recovery 
-- monitoring dashboards 

6 database engines:
MySQL, Oracle,  MicrosoftSQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Aurora
